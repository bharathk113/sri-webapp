PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

1. Create a folder named "assets" inside the "public" folder of your project.
   Full Path: .../sri-webapp/public/assets/

2. Place your images in this folder and rename them EXACTLY as follows:

   Image 1 (Map of Godavari Basin):
   Name: study-area.png
   
   Image 2 (Comparison Map - Traditional/Areal Method):
   Name: comparison-areal.png

   Image 3 (Comparison Map - Proposed/Grid-wise Method):
   Name: comparison-gridwise.png

3. Once these files are in place, run "npm run build" and "npm run deploy".
